# üî≠ OpenTelemetry in Action on Kubernetes: Part 7 - Let There Be Logs, Observability‚Äôs Final Pillar with Loki

## ü™µ Logs: The Footprints of Your System

**Logs** are timestamped records of events that happen in your system ‚Äî like breadcrumbs left behind by your application as it performs operations. They help you understand what happened, when it happened, and often why it happened.

In observability, logs play a key role when:

* Metrics show a spike but don‚Äôt tell you why.
* Traces reveal latency but not the root cause.
* You want to debug something that happened at 3 AM‚Ä¶ last Thursday.

## üß∞ Meet Loki ‚Äî Prometheus for Logs

**Loki**, built by the folks at Grafana Labs, is a log aggregation system designed to be:

* **Lightweight**: It indexes only labels, not the full log content.
* **Kubernetes-native**: Integrates beautifully with pod logs.
* **Prometheus-like**: Designed to feel familiar if you‚Äôve used Prometheus.

Instead of shipping logs to a bulky ELK stack, Loki works smoothly with Promtail, FluentBit, or OpenTelemetry Collector to aggregate logs from across your cluster.

## üöÄ Deploying Loki in Kubernetes

Let‚Äôs deploy Loki using a simple YAML manifest that includes:

1. A **Deployment** to run the Loki service
2. A **Service** to expose Loki inside the cluster
3. A **ConfigMap** to configure how Loki receives and stores logs

```yaml

The Loki manifest sets up a log aggregator inside your Kubernetes cluster that listens for incoming logs on a defined port. The service makes Loki accessible to other components, such as the OTEL Collector, while the ConfigMap gives Loki its brain ‚Äî deciding how logs flow and where they go.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Updating OpenTelemetry Collector to Send Logs to Loki

We now need to tell the **OTEL Collector Agent** to collect logs using the `filelog` receiver and ship them off to Loki. Here's the flow:

* `filelog`: Reads logs from Kubernetes pod files.
* `loki exporter`: Pushes these logs to the Loki service using HTTP.

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /var/log/pods/*/*/*.log ]
    start_at: beginning
    include_file_path: true
    include_file_name: true

exporters:
  loki:
    endpoint: "http://loki.observability.svc.cluster.local:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
    tls:
      insecure: true
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true

service:
  pipelines:
    # collect logs using 'filelog' receiver and ship them to loki
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [loki]
```

## üöÄ Deploying Loki to Kubernetes

```bash
# Apply the Loki manifests
kubectl -n observability apply -f loki.yaml

# Verify Loki is running
kubectl -n observability get pods -l app=loki

# check readiness of loki
curl -X GET "http://$(kubectl -n observability get svc -l app=loki -o json | jq -r '.items[].spec.clusterIP'):3100/ready"
```

## üëÄ What‚Äôs Next?

In **Part 8**, we‚Äôll bring everything together with **Grafana** ‚Äî the ultimate observability dashboard:

* Visualizing traces from **Jaeger**
* Querying metrics from **Prometheus**
* Searching logs from **Loki**
* All in a single unified interface.

The observability trifecta ‚Äî complete, powerful, and open source. Stay tuned. üéØ
